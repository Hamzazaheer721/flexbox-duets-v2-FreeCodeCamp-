/*if you apply automargins to flex items, it will automatically adjust its specified margin to occupy the extra space in */
/* in flex container, depending upon the direction in which this auto margin has been applied */

/* what this means is that setting the margin property on flex child will push the child away from that direction */
/* seting the margin-left: auto will push the child to most right side */
/* settting the margin-top: auto will push the child to the bottom */
/* sometimes justify-self and align-self may not give the best position then it would work for you */

/* if you want to make flexbox responsive then you'll have to given flex property to each of the child */
/* giving flex 1 to all the child will make flex do maths for you and give equal widths to the containers */
/* .container > div{
  flex: 1
} */

/* giving flex:2 will make a specific flex child take 2x times more space  */

/* Lecture# 3  */

/* flex basis will decide the width of the div if its flex direction is row */
/* if the size of the container is 800 and we give 400 basis to 2 flex children */
/* then empty space to the right will be remaining in the container */
/* setting flex-grow:1 for each flex children will make both equally take that empty space */
/* setting flex-grow to each of one will make one take all the remaining space */
/* default value of flex is flex: 1 1 0  <=> flex: 1*/
/* flex grow, flex shrink, flex basis */



/* Lecture# 4 */
/* Flex shrink will first wait for the flex-basis to reach then if the width gets smaller than flex-basis */
/* it will decide how a flex child will shrink comparatively */
